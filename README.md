# RSS-o-Bot Desktop Notifier

Adds support for desktop notifications to RSS-o-Bot. It accepts no options.

## Installation

### Mac OS

Mac OS only allows notifications to be sent from RSS-o-Bot. In order to get around this limitation I'm using [**terminal-notifier**](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier). It has to be installed manually. So please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/julienXX/terminal-notifier#download).

### Linux and Windows

RSS-o-Bot Desktop notifier is untested on both of these platform. Both of these platforms do not support simply linking a notificaiton. So the notifier is a bit useless. *I'm planning to bundle RSS-o-Bot in electron and use it to send notifications.* That way it would be possible to show a list of all new links, and send linked notifications on all platforms.
